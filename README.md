Issue. When using GameObjectContext you sometimes need to get an event when root object has beed disabled on enabled. With the help of this tool you can be notificated about this events via interfaces. 
You just need to add GameObjectKernel component to you GameObjectContext and you can implement IEnableEventHandler and IDisableEventHandler.
